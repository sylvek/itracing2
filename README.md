# PLEASE CONSIDER THIS APP' AS NOT MAINTAINED
I'm sorry, but time is missing to continue to maintain Itracing2 :(
Feel free, to fork it and to add new feature :)

# itracing2
itracing2 is a free and open source application that allows to (really?) use iTag devices.

This application runs in background, so you do not have to launch it after each boot up.

Several actions are available :

* Cpture your current position
* Rnging your phone
* Vbrate your phone
* Call a custom URL (`GET` action)

Manipulate the camera is not allowed unless the entire app is re-written (so, this is not my priority).

[you could try the beta version !](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/net.sylvek.itracing2)

# Special thanks!

- Thanks to PAINTKILLER (se-sktv@mail.ru) to his russian translation :)

**Don't forget that is a personal project and feel free to participate :)**
